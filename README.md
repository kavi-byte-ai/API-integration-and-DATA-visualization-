#DESCRIPTION

I recently completed an internship program with CODTECH IT Solutions, where I had the opportunity to work on exciting projects and gain hands-on experience in Python programming. During my time at CODTECH, I worked on various tasks that helped me develop my skills in software development, problem-solving, and collaboration.

Task 1: API Integration and Data Visualization One of the first tasks assigned to me was to integrate an API and visualize the retrieved data using Python. The goal was to fetch data from a public API, process it, and create informative visualizations to gain insights.

My internship experience at CODTECH IT Solutions was enriching and challenging. The API integration and data visualization task was an excellent introduction to the world of data science and software development.This experience has not only improved my technical skills but also taught me the importance of teamwork, communication, and problem-solving in a professional setting.
